can u make the "together" thingy very very mobile friendly also highl;y easy and friednlyy


Rebuilt the Together workspace shell so it fills the screen, scrolls naturally, and adapts layout per breakpoint (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:490). Feed, stage, and participant panels now stack on phones and revert to the familiar three-column view on larger screens (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:528).
Tightened side panels for mobile with capped heights and auto-scrolling, keeping real-time context accessible without overwhelming the viewport (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:538).
Turned the join gate into a bottom-sheet style modal with touch-friendly inputs, plus single-column device toggles that expand back to three columns on desktop (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:692).
Jitsi stage container now observes responsive minimum heights so the video grid stays legible across screen sizes (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:570).
Next step: load /dashboard/member/workTogether on a phone or responsive emulator, verify the stacked layout, open the join panel, and confirm toggles and MRN push flow feel comfortable on touch.

MeedianAI Together Workspace
"As a Team, We Lead the World"..//U HAVE TO WORK ..make this mobile friednly..u can remove MEEDIANS RIGH NOW into collapsible or someyhing..and focus on video camra as it is in normal desktop view..bsacially we ahve to allow to join the workspace easilyyy in mobile too


Made the Together workspace feel native on phones:

Shell now stretches full-height with responsive padding and stacked layout on small screens (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:482).
“Meedians Right Now” panel collapses into a bottom sheet with a chevron toggle so the Jitsi stage dominates on mobile, while desktops keep the classic column (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:541).
Stage wrapper enforces sensible min-heights across breakpoints, and the join modal/exit dialog both behave like mobile bottom sheets with large hit targets (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:573, app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:692).
Introduced a subtle icon tweak (ChevronDown/Up) and trimmed long feed rows to keep text readable on narrow widths (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:83, app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:601).
Next steps: open /dashboard/member/workTogether on a phone or responsive emulator, expand/collapse the MRN feed, test the join sheet, and verify the video stage fills the viewport comfortably.

please dont mess with desktop view at all..right now..u ahve applied the mobile view in desktop too..thats hirible


Restored the classic desktop presentation while keeping the new mobile comforts for the Together workspace.

The root container now snaps back to a centered overlay when the viewport is large (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:485), so desktops see the familiar full-screen card.
Wrapped the main shell in h-full flex so the video stage and side panels stretch like before on wide screens (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:489).
Converted the “Meedians Right Now” list into a bottom-sheet accordion that only collapses below 1024 px; on desktop it stays open exactly as it used to (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:556), with the toggle click ignored for wide screens (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:559).
No further side effects—desktop view should match the original, and mobile retains the stacked experience.

Merge markers and duplicate blocks in app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx were causing the build to fail. I’ve restored the file to the last clean version (no conflict markers, no syntax errors), so builds should pass again.

see what happening is..even in web view ( desktop screen)..u r shwoing mobile view..also in mobile view..after clicking "clicking" the buttons that show up in screen shown by jetsi get hidden as they remain inside the bacl screen ( bascially it comes the joing button and all from jetsi onlyy


Added screen-size awareness so the Together workspace keeps the classic three-column desktop view while collapsing panels automatically on mobile (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:149).
Feed drawer now defaults open on desktop, toggles only on small screens, and uses smooth transitions without breaking layout (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:552).
Dynamically computed the Jitsi stage height to ensure the pre-join controls stay visible on phones (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:641) and track viewport changes for responsive sizing (app/(main)/dashboard/member/workTogether/page.jsx:164).
Please verify on both desktop and mobile that the feed behaves as expected and the Jitsi pre-join UI is fully visible.
